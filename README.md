# reddit-replica
An application replicating Reddit that allows users to view and search posts provided by the API.

**How to use:**
Input a word or phrase in the Searchbar where 'Enter a topic' is autofilled. Afterwards, click the orange button and the first 25 posts most relevant to your search will be displayed. You can click the up or down button to add your own vote to each post. Because the netscore is displayed in-between arrows, both actions increment by 1 based on your choice. The title, post image, number of comments, and account name are also displayed. All displayed data is given from the undocumented Reddit API here: https://github.com/reddit-archive/reddit/wiki/JSON. If a post image is not available, the alt text 'no post image' will be displayed. Have fun searching around my mini Reddit!
